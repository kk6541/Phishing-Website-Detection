# Phishing-Website-Detection

Phishing assaults are one of the more prevalent types of cybercrime in the world today. To steal information, users are sent 
emails and messages. Moreover, websites are used for it. Phishing primarily targets corporate websites, such as those for e-commerce, finance, and governmental organizations. To obtain sensitive user information, attackers impersonate websites, 
a phenomenon known as phishing. In addition to exploring the use of machine learning algorithms to identify and stop web 
phishing assaults, this research suggests utilizing machine learning techniques to detect phishing URLs by analyzing various 
aspects of the URLs. The study includes classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision trees, 
KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, and other ensemble learning techniques like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Histogram Gradient 
Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting, and Ada Boost were used to detect phishing websites
